# Thoughts on Spotting and Cameras for iRacing's Bathurst 12HR

tl;dr: I created a camera group [1] for spotting for the iRacing's *Bathurst 12HR*. You can download it [here](bathurst_advspot_v2.cam). Directions for use are below. The name of the camera group is **AdvSpot** (short for "advance spotter").

[1] A *camera group* is any arbitrary set of camera shots in iRacing. E.g. *TV1* is a camera group: when you watch TV1, the camera shot will change to different individual cameras in the TV1 group.

I applied the following philosophy to create this group:

1. You should **clearly** 5 seconds ahead of the *spotted car* at all times.
2. You should see the *spotted car* at all times.
3. Static shots of the track are preferred.
4. Your view should be such that your left is the driver's left.

I was not able to always apply these rules, but I did apply them in the above priority.

#### 1. You should *clearly see* 5 seconds ahead of the *spotted car* at all times.

I hope this one is obvious.

### 2. You should see the *spotted car* at all times.




The cameras was created on a widescreen monitor (3440 x 1440), so it may not work for you. Feel free to adjust to your heart's content.


A motivating example:

The #8 Ferrari (foreground right) is not.
